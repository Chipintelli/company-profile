Powered by fully in-house algorithms, Chipintelli delivers end-to-end voice-interaction capabilities: single-mic and array beam-forming, noise suppression, echo cancellation, ultra-low-power wake-up, on-device semantic parsing, and voice-print ID. Our proprietary “local self-learning” engine lets users add or adapt commands on the fly, solving dialect and personalization issues without cloud help.
**Recognition accuracy exceeds 97 % and recognition range can reache beyond 5 meters, setting the industry benchmark.**

# Applications 
Based on the chipintelli's self-developed AI speech chips and AI algorithms, our chip can be applied to a wide range of fields, including but not limited to **smart homes, smart appliances, smart lighting, smart toys, smart robots, smart cars etc.,**

**We will launch several open-source initiatives in the upcopming months** and we look forward to your engagement in our initiative
